Paulson explains, \u201cMy personal definition of a ghost is a shadow of life perceived in a way that defies reality. A ghost can be the intelligent spirit of the deceased, persisting after death because of unfinished business, or it can be residual energy of the living or deceased, imprinted onto a location or object.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Paulson reveals some indicators that can be telling while advising many hauntings a misunderstood which is why it\u2019s recommended to learn the history of your home that will help you identify possible paranormal activity. There are many means to learn about the history behind the property such as asking your real estate or leasing agent, searching public property records in your area, and even Google your home address to see if you can find any names of previous owners or tenants (pay attention to any obituaries.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Another option is learning more from neighbors that are familiar with the former owners or renters and possibly have some insight into the home\u2019s past. Paulson also recommends taking note of how you, house guests, and animals emotionally feel in the present taking inventory of feelings your home brings for any sense of unrest.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>These are some strong signs to figure out if there is a trapped or unrest spirit in your home:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0 Strange Sounds \u2013 hearing things out of the ordinary such as doors creaking open, knocking, disembodied voices, footsteps, and knocking.\u00a0\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Objective Movement \u2013 instances, where you misplace an item as spirits, will sometimes move objects to show their presence.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Cold Spots \u2013 paranormal presence can be indicated by a change in temperature with subtle bursts or shifts of cold air that is believed ghosts draw energy, drawing heat from the environment where they are present.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Phantom Smells \u2013 you might notice a certain scent, looking for where it\u2019s coming from, but you can\u2019t figure out the origin.
