Making them observe the weather and discussing climate are the best ways to teach kids about the weather as they can notice the changes in the seasons themselves.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It is important to provide them with information on what todo in case the weather is bad or when there is a severe storm or other related disasters in the forecast. Parents and teachers can do a lot of things to educate children at home and in school about weather and climate. We recommend some of the best ways to educate kids on weather and meteorology.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Keep A Weather Journal<\/h3>\n<p>Let the children record their observations regarding the weather in a journal throughout the year. The children can also click pictures of different weather scenes and paste them into their journals. They can also draw the different shapes, colors, and sizes of clouds they see.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It is also a good idea to have them write words related to the weather in the weather vocabulary section of their journals. Such weather journals are a great way for them to keep track of all the information and observations of weather that they have gathered. At the end of the year, they can review all that they have learned about the various weather patterns.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Let Them Watch\/Read About The Weather<\/h3>\n<p>Children can do this on TV, or they can read local newspapers. As a teacher or parent, you can read the weather forecast out to them, discuss it, and discuss what the meteorologists say. Provide them with the meaning of the words they used and educate them on it.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Share with them their observations, and the kids who are more passionate and interested in weather can be asked to watch &#8216;The Weather Channel&#8217; and collect facts to be later shared and discussed with others. Watching programs on TV on extreme weather, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and blizzards, can also ignite the children&#8217;s interest in weather and will make learning about it more fun.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Choose Fun AND Frugal Activities<\/h3>\n<p>You might save a lot of money by planning small birthdays and buying secondhand items. Still, family activities are hard to tackle. Your kids might want to go for a vacation, and you can\u2019t afford it. The best way to tackle this situation is to take your kids to the nearest community park every weekend. This will keep them happy, and they won\u2019t ask for an expensive vacation in the Bahamas.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>Go On Trips<\/h3>\n<p>You can take your kid or class to the local meteorology department. Most of these are happy to give study tours to school children. You can invite a meteorologist over to your school to give a small talk and a presentation in front of the class.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Building A Weather Station<\/h3>\n<p>Keep your children engaged by helping them with experiments related to weather activities. Many simple methods are readily available.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>You can utilize stuff from home to create an outside weather station where the children can have hands-on experience of recording and collecting data. They can be taught to make their own rain gauge, thermometer, rainbow, water cycle, volcano, clouds, etc.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Move And Sing<\/h3>\n<p>Take a break and let the children lose it. Let them roll and twirl like a tornado or watch them melt like ice. Let them roar like Thunder. Get more of their attention by making up funny songs about weather yourself or find weather song resources online.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>You could plan a weather costume day. Children love dressing up, so give them a chance to dress up and help them make their weather-related costumes in class.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts\u00a0<\/h3>\n<p>Children love being outside, playing in the sun, splashing in the rain, and looking up at the clouds. They are naturally curious and eager to learn and know about everything. It is up to us to harness their in-born inquisitiveness and teach them about the weather and climate in ways that they can easily understand.\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<footer id=\"footer\">\n<div class=\"inner\"><\/div>\n<\/footer>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>he weather and the climate are things that children can relate to easily, and all sorts of weather affect the lives of children everyday.
