Some parents are stricter while others are more lenient and have never considered their naturally developed parenting styles.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Based on the scientific work by developmental psychologist Diana Baumrind with Stanford researchers John Martin and Eleanor Maccoby, they have developed four main parenting styles. Each parenting style is ranked depending on the levels of responsiveness and demandingness with certain characteristics with each parenting style.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Permissive (higher responsiveness and lower in demandingness) parenting rarely gives or enforces rules. Permissive parents are also child-driven, often overindulging their child to avoid conflict sometime sat the parent\u2019s own success.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The permissive parenting style demonstrates low demandingness, high responsiveness, and communicates openly while usually letting the kids decide for themselves rather than giving directions. Permissive parents are more likely to establish a friendship role over a parent role as these parents allow their children to do what they want with limited guidance.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The authoritative (higher responsiveness and higher in demandingness) parenting style is more strict setting clear expectations and rules imposed upon the child. This parenting style also helps to solve problems together with the child, open communication, and natural consequences.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Authoritative parents communicate frequently listening while taking into consideration the thoughts of children\u2019s opinions, thoughts, and feelings. This parenting style helps to guide children through honest and open discussion that teaches reasoning and value. Children of authoritative parents tend to think for themselves instilling self-discipline.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The neglectful (lower responsiveness and lower in demandingness) parenting style is being absent or uninvolved of their child. Neglectful parenting provides little guidance or nurturing while parents feelin different to a child\u2019s behavioral and social-emotional needs.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Children of neglectful parents commonly struggle with self-esteem issues and have a hard time forming close relationships. This parenting style is heavily related to an overall sense of indifference and neglectful parents may seem uncaring and cold as they often face struggles with their own issues.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The authoritarian (lower responsiveness and higher in demandingness) parenting style is parent-driven, setting strict rules and punishment. Authoritarian parents often display having one-way communication with little consideration of the child\u2019s social-behavioral and emotional needs.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Authoritarian parents often see communication as a one-way interaction from parent to a child with a rigid parenting style enforcing stern discipline that is called \u201ctough love.\u201d This one-way communication system is an attempt to maintain complete control with parents talking to their children without being open to feedback or input.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>You might relate to one of these parenting styles or learn more about it to build a better relationship for your child and demonstrate less productive styles of parenting that might impact the family relationship.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No two children are raised the same as there are different types of parenting styles.
