Teenagers these days have grown up in a world where social media was already in full swing by the time, they gained consciousness. Social media is still a new concept to their parents since all of their socializing was done either face to face or on landline phones!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that teenagers feel overwhelmed by their parents&#8217; raising concerns about social media. Parents need to give their children some leverage and understand where they are coming from:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Teens Are More Vigilant Than You Think<\/h3>\n<p>One of the parents&#8217; major parental concerns regarding social media is the continual interaction with strangers. There is no doubt that creepy strangers are on every platform, and we are afraid of who is susceptible to their charms.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that social media awareness has helped most teens realize when they are being stalked by suspicious people online. When needed, they do not hesitate to use the block button and remove these strangers from their online presence.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Social Media Connections Are Real<\/h3>\n<p>Online friends are a joke in most older millennials and GenX communities. How are you even friends if you cannot see them in person?\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Social media has made it possible to befriend people all over the world. These friends are as close to your kids as their friends in person, and they should not be ashamed of making new connections like this.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Research from the Pew Research Center has shown that 57% of teenagers have made new friends online, and these connections are usually perfectly alright. The only concerning bit is the balance teenagers should establish between online friends and in-person friends, and this is where the parents can help.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Teenagers Can Filter Through Bogus Information<\/h3>\n<p>There are scores of false information online, and parents fear their children learning things that are not true. The tables have turned in this regard since teenagers are better at sifting through fake information than most adults! Older adults are more likely to fall for fake news on social media than teenagers, making the circulation of fake news something teenagers should worry about more than adults!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>It Helps Teenagers Stay Updated\u00a0<\/h3>\n<p>Since teenagers are better at sifting through fake news online, they are also better at staying updated with the world. News that media outlets censor circulates freely on social media, and older teenagers know better than to believe anything that hasn&#8217;t been verified. Social media also helps teenagers stay updated with their friends and family, therefore sharing a connection with them.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Not Everything On Social Media Is Bad<\/h3>\n<p>Many parents still vilify social media and massively limit their teens&#8217; screen time because of it. Parents need to realize that limiting some screen time and monitoring is necessary, but not everything about social media is bad!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Staying online actually helps teens stay connected with the world and not miss out on important events. Therefore, social media is more than just bad occurrences.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The generational divide that social media has created between teenagers and their parents is unlike any other.
