Teenagers these days have grown up in a world where social media was already in full swing by the time, they gained consciousness. Social media is still a new concept to their parents since all of their socializing was done either face to face or on landline phones!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that teenagers feel overwhelmed by their parents&#8217; raising concerns about social media. Parents need to give their children some leverage and understand where they are coming from:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Get Rid Of The Labels<\/h3>\n<p>We exist in a society that dwells on labeling educated, famous, successful, athletic, musical, gifted, etc. Labels generally help us in categorizing things however, when it comes to children, labels (deliberate or unintended) can generate unhealthy competition leading to sibling rivalry.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We inadvertently put our children into one position or another, whether they like it or not, and establish comparisons between siblings by categorizing them. The good news is that removing the labels allows our &#8220;not-so-athletic&#8221; children to flourish even if they aren&#8217;t starred. We allow straight-B students to be proud of their accomplishments. And we offer the &#8220;crazy child&#8221; the opportunity to do things right.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The idea is to highlight good characteristics such as unity, perseverance, and kindness. Instead of fighting for their parents&#8217; praise, siblings may root for one another.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Ease The Tension<\/h3>\n<p>If your children cannot come to an agreement, or when the dispute worsens, you may need to intervene. Don&#8217;t take sides in any way. You may believe you overheard or saw what ignited the disagreement, but you should not pass judgment on either person.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Instead, once everyone has calmed down, listen to each child&#8217;s account of what occurred and advise them to use &#8220;I feel&#8221; phrases when telling their narrative. Then, without pointing fingers or taking sides, please encourage them to work on some solutions; you can also propose a few yourself and assist them in reaching an agreement.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Make Arrangements For Attention Time<\/h3>\n<p>One of the primary reasons children fight is to get their parents&#8217; attention- even negative attention works to none in their perspective. Try to give each kid at least 10 minutes of focused attention every day to satisfy their desire for attention. Another helpful tip is cutting out distractions like leaving your phone off or on silent, don&#8217;t respond to emails, and turning off the TV.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>For these 10 minutes, your child is the focus of your universe, and you must be wholly there with them. By providing each child with this special attention, you will create a sense of emotional closeness and fill their attention bucket with positivity, minimizing the chances of fights to seek your (negative) attention.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Avoid Disputes<\/h3>\n<p>This may surprise you, but do you know the wisest thing you could do when a fight escalates? Don&#8217;t worry about it. That&#8217;s correct, do something different in another room.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t pay any heed to the dispute. By ignoring the conflict, you avoid rewarding bad behavior with your attention and, more significantly, you leave them to resort to it on their own.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>To Conclude<\/h3>\n<p>While you play the role of a mother to end sibling rivalries, it&#8217;s essential to be very patient with your children. Give them a chance to make mistakes and help them do better as siblings and individuals. We wish you happiness and peace on your parenting journey.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The generational divide that social media has created between teenagers and their parents is unlike any other.
