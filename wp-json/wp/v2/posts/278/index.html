This might not seem easy being presented as a challenging uphill task. According to a 2019 study, gratitude is associated with happiness in children by five.

Experiencing these feelings can help children find satisfaction easily with their family, friends, and the community in general.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Grateful children are stronger, perform better in school, and participate in hobbies compared to children displaying ungrateful characteristics that are more prone to being materialistic or sad. There are numerous reasons why it is vital to assist children in experiencing and expressing gratitude. You can use strategies and lessons to teach your kids to be grateful are discussed below.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Saying Thank You<\/h3>\n<p>Though saying thank you verbally might not be expressing genuine gratitude, encouraging your children to say it when somebody gives or does something for them will help them learn to express genuine gratitude later on in life.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Keep giving the child gentle reminders regularly to get into the habit. As a way to thank people who give them gifts or show them kindness, kids can write short \u2018thank you&#8217; notes. Also, appreciate and praise the child when they express gratitude independently without a reminder or a prompt from you. As a result of your positive actions and attention, they will recognize and value the importance of gratitude even more.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Ask Questions<\/h3>\n<p>To foster a more profound sense of gratitude in the child, you should ask a lot of questions. Ask them about the things and people in their life that they are grateful for. Parents can also ask them about what they think about the gifts or presents they have received from others and how it makes them feel.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Having conversations with them about gratitude and what it really means helps progress the process. Give them more meaning and understanding of gratitude by incorporating other elements of gratitude so that they don\u2019t just pay lip service by saying thank you.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>During difficult times, help your child look at the positive sides of the situation. Teach them to look at the bright side and that good can come out of difficult circumstances. They can be taught that it is okay to be sad and grateful at the same time when honoring a loss, such as being grateful for something that you had but don\u2019t have any more like a pet.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Be A Role Model<\/h3>\n<p>When kids see their parents showing and expressing gratitude regularly, they learn to do the same. Parents need to be role models for their children simply by sharing your feelings of gratitude with your kids even when you have had a bad day or something bad has happened. Point out to your children that there is still a lot that you can be grateful for.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Get Everybody Involved<\/h3>\n<p>Start a family project that gets everyone thinking and talking about gratitude as many things can be done to inculcate that habit in your kids. Children can take turns daily to talk about things they are grateful for when they sit down for dinner.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>At bedtime, they can be made to say a prayer expressing gratitude for the day or use a bulletin board to put up where children can add notes every day about what they are thankful for. Another option is writing notes that can be stored in a gratitude jar that they can reflect upon later by reading them together as a family activity you can determine is best for your schedule.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts\u00a0<\/h3>\n<p>Parents should make the expression of gratitude a priority in their homes. They should find strategies and practices that most suit their family and lifestyle.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Parents will also have times when their children might seem to be ungrateful, this should not be taken to mean that you have failed to teach your kids to be grateful.
