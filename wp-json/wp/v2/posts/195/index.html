Fortunately, we had guardians and parents who helped us overcome our fears back in our days. If your child is going through the same phase and has developed fear and anxiety, your reaction to your child&#8217;s behavior will heavily influence how they cope with anxious thoughts. There are a couple of techniques that can assist an anxious kid in dealing with uncomfortable thoughts or others.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Help Them Identify The Difference Between Real Threat And False Alarm<\/h3>\n<p>Your child may have real fears, like fear of an exam, a strict teacher, an animal, a sport, but some fears are only in their head. Fears that trigger a false alarm in your child\u2019s head can develop long-term anxiety that is sometimes difficult to identify.<\/p>\n<p>Please help your child sense the changes in their body when they have real-time threats such as increased heartbeat, sweaty palms, nervousness, or urge to hide. Then remind them that there are instances when their brain sends out a false alert.<\/p>\n<p>Such false alerts may cause people to experience tremendous dread in situations that aren&#8217;t life-or-death. Situations such as going out for a team match, presenting in front of many people, or prepping for multiple tests can result in false alarms.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Validate Their Emotions<\/h3>\n<p>If your child comes up to you and expresses concern, avoid saying things like &#8220;that&#8217;s not a big deal&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8217;s only in your head.&#8221; This can result in two possibilities: they will never open up to you, and their fears will be aggravated. When your child opens up about their fear, always be empathetic and compassionate. This will not only give them the courage to confront their fears, but it will also strengthen your relationship.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>The Practice Of Deep Breathing<\/h3>\n<p>Slow, deep breathing has been proved effective by research to alleviate symptoms of both anxiety and depression. If your child has a lot of apparent symptoms of anxiety, such as a racing heart or muscle fatigue, show them how to relax their body with some basic breathing techniques. You can go about by playing a breathing game with them, such as counting their breaths or bubble blowing, or ask them to imitate you while you show them how to take deep breaths.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Consider Professional Help<\/h3>\n<p>Consult a pediatrician if your child&#8217;s anxiousness lasts longer than two weeks. If your child&#8217;s uneasiness interferes with their quality of life, you should take immediate action. Depression and anxiety are treatable, yet they frequently go unnoticed and misdiagnose. Your child&#8217;s pediatrician may recommend him or her to a mental health specialist for treatment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>The Take-Away<\/h3>\n<p>Although dealing with your child&#8217;s anxiety can be daunting for many parents, the great news is that they can surpass it. Following these techniques and building a more profound connection of love and care will help empower your child to deal with everyday adversities.<\/p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dealing with anxiety at a young age might harm the development of one&#8217;s personality.
