If you want to arrange a sleep-over for your kid but aren\u2019t sure how to go about it, we have some tips for you to follow.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s everything you need to know about hosting your child\u2019s first sleep-over:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Make Sure Your Child Is Ready<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s probably a good idea to wait until your child is at least6 or 7 years old before allowing a sleep-over so that things can go off without a hitch and you do not end the night with any weepy children wanting to go home. If your child has brought up the idea themselves and is excited about planning, then they&#8217;re probably ready to have a sleep-over.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Stay In Contact With Your Guest&#8217;s Parents<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re inviting one or two of your child&#8217;s friends to stay, be sure to stay in contact with their parents. Inform them about the whole plan beforehand, letting them know what time to drop off the kids and pick them up, as well as any plans for food and activities. Also, let them know that they can call you anytime if they get worried about their kids.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Plan Out Some Fun And Healthy Food<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s probably a good idea to plan some fun and healthy food for snacks, dinner, and breakfast the next morning. The food should be healthy and filling while also keeping in mind any allergies or restrictions your child&#8217;s guests may have in their diet.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Activities That The Children Can Enjoy<\/h3>\n<p>While it can be helpful to plan out some activities for the kids to do during their sleep-over, it may be best to leave them to whatever they want to do and not micro-manage. You can pick out a selection of movies for them to watch and have a few board games and magazines on hand, but don&#8217;t force any activities on them if they would rather just stay in the bedroom and talk.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Be Strict With Bedtime And Sleeping Arrangements<\/h3>\n<p>Although a sleep-over is very fun and exciting, be sure to have the children in bed at a reasonable time. An hour or so above their bedtime is okay, but they shouldn\u2019t be staying up longer than that. If you want to avoid any arguing or fights, it\u2019s best to have the same sleeping arrangements for your child and their guests too. You can lay out sleeping bags and blankets for all the kids on the bedroom or lounge floor.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Try And Be Prepared For Emergencies<\/h3>\n<p>Keep extra toothbrushes and pajamas on hand and have all your guests&#8217; emergency contacts saved on your phone or in a notebook. It&#8217;s better to be prepared for any emergencies or incidents than get stressed out at the last minute.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Hosting your child\u2019s first sleep-over is a great honor, and your child will love you for it! Follow the tips we\u2019ve given you, and we\u2019re sure that everything will go off without a hitch.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Having a sleep-over is one of the most exciting things for a young child to do and makes them feel grown-up and brave.
