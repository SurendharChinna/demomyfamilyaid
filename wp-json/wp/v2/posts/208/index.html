Exercise regularly throughout pregnancy helps improve your posture and alleviate joint pain and discomfort such as cramps and lethargy.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>There is evidence that physical activity can prevent future diabetes during pregnancy, reduce stress, and increase stamina for pregnancy and delivery. If you have been working out before you conceived, you should continue but in moderation. So instead of going overboard with your workout regime, do what is easiest to keep you active so that you can also use it as a chance to spend more time with your partner by working out together.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Light Cardio<\/h3>\n<p>Trekking, swimming, walking, and mechanical cycling are popular cardiovascular exercises throughout all three trimesters. Unless your doctor has advised you otherwise the Department of Health and Human Services Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans indicates pregnant women are encouraged to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. If you&#8217;re used to doing high-intensity workouts like running or have a high level of fitness, it is safe to continue the same throughout pregnancy with your doctor&#8217;s permission, of course.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>First Trimester<\/h3>\n<p>The first trimester can be a roller-coaster ride. You are embracing motherhood and sudden changes in your body. While doctors recommend going for a light workout during the first three months, you can continue with regular exercise if your case is not a high-risk pregnancy. These are a few easy workouts to consider during the trimester:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Pelvic Curl<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lie on your back, with knees bent, feet planted on the floor, about hip-width apart. Breathe in deep to relax, then breathe out as you curl your pelvis (or hips) so that your spine is flat on the floor.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Pelvic Brace<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Do this for the duration of your pregnancy, as long as you are not experiencing pelvic muscles problems like painful sex or urine incontinence. Lie down on your back, knees arched and feet resting on the ground, hip-width apart.\u00a0Make a &#8220;neutral&#8221; position for your pelvis and lower back. Make sure you&#8217;re resting on the rear of your pelvis and making a small space on your lower back.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Squats<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Squats can help with cramps and alleviate pain in the lower back.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Upper Body Workout<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Your lower body is sensitive around pregnancy, but you may continue with intense upper body workouts if you are used to it.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Second Trimester<\/h3>\n<p>With things starting to shift and grow in the second trimester, doctors advise expecting mothers to keep working on core strength, emphasizing the inner thighs and hips. Some workouts to consider during the second trimester includes:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Mermaid Stretch<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0As your baby grows, it may put a strain on your diaphragm and ribs, which can be uncomfortable. Stretching can release the pressure and help in baby\u2019s movement.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Incline Push-ups\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Push-ups are great for strengthening the core; you can put your hands in an inclined position to avoid stress on the baby.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Leg Raises While Resting On Your Side<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0It&#8217;s critical to strengthen the muscles that aid in balance and pelvic stabilization to prepare for your shifting center of gravity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Third Trimester<\/h3>\n<p>These exercises help in maintaining the strength of your upper and lower body muscles. This is an excellent time to concentrate on aerobic training while still maintaining your flexibility and abdominal strength by doing the following safe exercises:\u00a0<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prenatal Yoga<\/li>\n<li>Walking<\/li>\n<li>Swimming<\/li>\n<li>Bodyweight Moves For Pilates<\/li>\n<li>Pelvic Floor Exercises<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>To Conclude<\/h3>\n<p>Physical activity is healthy for both mother and baby during pregnancy. Give your body the attention it needs and stop if you are experiencing any physical discomfort. Consult your doctor for any queries on how your body reacts to a fitness regimen.\u00a0<\/p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Maintaining a regular fitness regimen throughout your pregnancy will benefit you in remaining healthy and feeling your best.
