This is more well-known for newborns, but it very much applies as children get older as well. Making sure your kids get enough sleep is not always easy, however, and at some point, you may have to help them through their sleep issues. Here are some great ways to help manage your children\u2019s bedtime.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>Pay Attention To Their Sleep<\/h3>\n<p>It is typically not difficult to tell if your child is overtired and did not get enough sleep. They may seem more moody, cranky, and display a general lack of focus that differs from their typical self. If you notice these patterns, pay attention to what is happening with their sleep. There are different solutions for different kinds of problems, but it is pivotal that you at least find out what the issue is.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Make Sleep A Family Event<\/h3>\n<p>One reason that your child may be resistant to bedtime is the fact that they feel they could miss something after they fall asleep. To alleviate this concern, set bedtime as a family so your child realizes that the day is over and that they need to mentally shift their attention to the next day. This should also help them fall asleep earlier as it will put their mind at ease.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Create A Routine For Your Child<\/h3>\n<p>The key to getting your child to fall asleep in a timely fashion is setting up a routine that slowly winds them down and gets them tired. Try to fashion this routine with them by having them do things that they enjoy but also relax them, such as reading or watching television. The lead-up to the event of going to bed being enjoyable and relaxing for your child will help them when it comes time to fall asleep.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Monitor Your Child&#8217;s Environment<\/h3>\n<p>Just as you prefer a good environment to catch your sleep in, your child will also benefit from being in a favorable environment. Supply them with what they need to feel physically and mentally comfortable to sleep in, whether this is a night light, or the fan running.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sleep is a critical part of your child\u2019s mood, behavior, and overall health and well-being.
