The truth typically is that there is no objectively correct way and that it depends solely on the personalities of the parents and children, as well as other family dynamics and variables in play. With that being said, there are some cornerstones of parenting. These are realities that will always be true no matter the situation, and you should be aware of these as a parent.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Your Role Matters<\/h3>\n<p>All evidence, whether it be anecdotal or scientific, shows us that children are heavily influenced by their parents. This means that your child will never naturally turn into the person that you want them to be with no guidance. This also means that not only do you need to lead with discipline, but also lead by example. Children are easily influenced and your example will be highly significant to their growth.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Show Your Love While Demanding Respect<\/h3>\n<p>To continue from the previous point, you need to show your children the importance that you have to them by loving them unconditionally and by always expressing this love for them. However, this love cannot turn into a situation where you are caving to them and allowing them to walk all over you. Channel the love you have for them to show them that you are an authority figure that must be respected as a result of your relationship with them.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Make Sure They Understand Your Rationale<\/h3>\n<p>The love that you have, and express, for your children also must translate into trust so that you have their mental attention to effectively raise them. One way to build this trust is to always explain your actions towards them, specifically the disciplinarian actions you take. They need to learn that you have a plan and a process for them. When they sense you are not acting with good intentions, they may question everything about their relationship with you. This is particularly true in the teenage years.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Parenting is an interesting subject because it is prone to debates over what the \u201ccorrect\u201d kind of parenting is.
