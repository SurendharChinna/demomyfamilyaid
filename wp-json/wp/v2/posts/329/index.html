If yes, what are you doing about it? Give this blog a read to understand how to build a strong relationship with your child.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The people who welcome their little ones into this world are parents. They put in all their effort and hard work to ensure that their children live a comfortable lifestyle. But in this process, they often forget to spend quality time with their child.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In the end, it&#8217;s not always the money that a child wants. The thing they want the most is their time. Even if you could take 15-20 minutes of a routine and just listen to them, that could solve their hundreds of problems and here\u2019s what you can do.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Schedule a daily 20\u201330-minute session with your child. It could be any time of the day, but your entire focus should be your child during that time. If the nature of your work doesn\u2019t allow you to be physically there with your child, try doing it through a video call.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If you cannot do any of these, write sweet messages on sticky notes and leave them in their drawer or the closet. Reading them can be a great start to their day. This is a great way to connect with your child.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Make a habit of eating one meal of your day with them. In this way, you can have a little chat with your child. It will also help them understand the importance of a family. Likewise, you can also plan a 10\u201315-minute drive with them and maybe get them their favorite ice cream or something.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Try to appreciate them even for their slightest achievements. An example can be completing the homework before time, doing well in school, etc. Acknowledging them for their efforts can be really motivating for them.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Another way to spend quality time is to play with them. You can do that during their bathtime or before going to bed. You can also get educational toys for your child. You can also teach them cricket, cycling, or any other activity. What matters is that you show them that you are involved in their life.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Try to use a friendly tone with them. Be polite and listen to them carefully. In this way, they can open more, and you can have a better conversation with them.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Plan your weekends in a way where you can spend most of your time with your child. Even if you are not able to spend time with your child due to the busy work schedule the entire week, this could compensate for it. Take them to their favorite place or an amusement park.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always quality over quantity. Whatever you do, make sure you give your little ones your full attention. You do not always have to do big things; keep it simple. Build a connection and try maintaining a work-life balance.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you finding it difficult to take time out for your child due to your busy work schedule?
