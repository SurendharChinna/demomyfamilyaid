Or are you done with feeding your baby canned food? Whatever the reason, we have the perfect solution to all your problems. Family meals don\u2019t just have to be for adults. You can make them so that the baby can enjoy them too.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s time you mix up some ingredients, grab that blender and knife, add in some creativity, and make safe and healthy meals for all ages. Let\u2019s get right into it!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Chicken Soup<\/h3>\n<p>It is not any chicken corn soup. It is made with shredded chicken breast, green beans, carrots, and whole wheat macaroni.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Toddler (12 months+):<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>If your toddler can\u2019t eat with a spoon yet, you can simply give this to them in a small bowl. However, if your toddler can eat with a spoon now, you can serve them this. Just make sure that the carrots are well shredded, so they don\u2019t choke. Make sure it\u2019s not hot so that they can drink it with ease.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Baby (6-12 months):<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>Now that your baby is on solids, you can puree the green beans, carrots, breastmilk, and chicken broth. You can entirely blend the soup in its broth if you have given them chicken a few times now, and it has sat well with them.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Veggies Meatloaf<\/h3>\n<p>It is one of the healthiest meals for the entire family, and it is equally essential for the baby to get their daily dose of greens and meat.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Toddler (12 months+):<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Start by cutting green beans into \u00bd inches and then make small slices of the meatloaf and serve this with mashed potatoes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Baby (6-12 months):<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>It is not safe to give your infant chunks of vegetables or meat. Blend the mashed potatoes and greens, then add water, beef broth, and breastmilk. Make the consistency according to what your baby will like.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Black Bean Quesadilla<\/h3>\n<p>You can make this with cheddar cheese, a whole wheat tortilla, diced tomatoes, black beans, chopped onions, guacamole, and plain Greek yogurt.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Toddler (12 months+):<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>You can serve the quesadilla as it is if your toddler is at that point. Or you can cut it into pieces\/mash it up nicely.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Baby (6-12 months):<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Puree is the best way to feed your infant \u2013 puree avocado with some banana and add some breastmilk. For babies that are a little older, you can serve these deconstructed.<\/p>\n<p>The entire family can enjoy these top three recipes. Eating the same food as the family will allow the baby to pick up on the family&#8217;s eating habits.
