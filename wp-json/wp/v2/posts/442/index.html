Oddly enough, there are fun cookie cutters out there of all shapes, including your kids\u2019 favorite characters.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>DIY Frosting Piping Bag:<\/h3>\n<p>For precise frosting decoration, you can make frosting piping bags from 1-gallon Ziplock bags, a large cup, and scissors. Once you have your cup ready, place your flat hand upright in any corner of the Ziplock bag.<\/p>\n<p>Then put your fingers together, creating a tip shape, and place your hand down in the cup. Then fold back a few inches of the bag and move the folds of the bag downwards gently. Then slowly place a spoon full of frosting into the bag. When the bag looks like it has the right amount, grab the end of the bag and bring it up to swirl the top of the pack. Once it is nice and tight, use the scissors to cut the tip.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h3>Cookie Dough Recipe<\/h3>\n<p>Use your personal family recipe for cookies from scratch or you can get store-bought cookie dough that can help save some prep time.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h3>Easy Options:<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re more about decorating and less interested in baking you can easily use store-bought products including icing, sprinkles, frosting, and baking mix. Another fun option is getting pre-made sugar cookies from the bakery department with a plain white frosting that can be customized with cute decorations.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A fun time with the family can start in the kitchen with a fun cookie decorating activity that can be enjoyed by the entire family.
