You and My FamilyAid hereby agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1, et seq. (\u201cFAA\u201d) applies to this agreement to arbitrate, and governs all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration. Unless you and we agree otherwise in writing, arbitration shall be administered by the JAMS International Arbitration Rules in effect at the time of filing of the arbitration (the \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d). However, just as a court would, the arbitrator or arbitrators must honor the terms and limitations in this agreement, and can award damages and relief (including any attorneys\u2019 fees) authorized by law and\/or the JAMS Rules. The arbitration decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. There is no judge or jury in arbitration and arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND My FamilyAid ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT, INCLUDING RIGHTS TO RECEIVE A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTION, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR CLASS ARBITRATIONS EVEN IF THE PROCEDURES OR RULES OF JAMS WOULD. RATHER, YOU AND WE ARE ONLY ENTITLED TO PURSUE ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL, BILATERAL BASIS. FURTHER, AND UNLESS YOU AND My FamilyAid AGREE OTHERWISE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL PARTY\u2019S CLAIMS WITH ANY OTHER PARTY\u2019S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR COLLECTIVE PROCEEDING. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. Arbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States county where you live or work, Ohio, or any other location we mutually agree to, subject to Ohio law. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. This agreement to arbitrate does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Indemnity<\/strong><span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>You agree to indemnify and hold each Company party harmless from any claim or demand, and any damages, costs, or expenses arising in connection with such claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and costs, made by any other party due to or arising out of your breach of this agreement or the documents it incorporates by reference, or your violation of any law or the right of another party.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Governing Law; Venue<\/strong><span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This agreement and its validity, construction and performance will be governed in all respects by the laws, and in the state and federal courts of the state of Ohio, without regard to its choice of law provisions. You irrevocably agree to accept the exclusive personal jurisdiction and waive any objections to the venue of such courts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SMS Terms And ConditionsShortcode: 82514 Welcome to FamAid (&#8220;The Service&#8221;), owned and operated by My Family Aid (&#8220;The Company&#8221;).
